==> Caveats
==> isl@0.18
isl@0.18 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

For compilers to find isl@0.18 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.18/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.18/include"

For pkg-config to find isl@0.18 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/isl@0.18/lib/pkgconfig"



postgresql issues
==> postgresql
To migrate existing data from a previous major version of PostgreSQL run:
  brew postgresql-upgrade-database

Warning: postgresql provides a launchd plist which can only be used on macOS!
You can manually execute the service instead with:
  pg_ctl -D /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/var/postgres start
d@pop-os:~$ 




==> python
Python has been installed as
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/python/libexec/bin

You can install Python packages with
  pip3 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/python3.7/site-packages






nvm
==> Caveats
Please note that upstream has asked us to make explicit managing
nvm via Homebrew is unsupported by them and you should check any
problems against the standard nvm install method prior to reporting.

You should create NVM's working directory if it doesn't exist:

  mkdir ~/.nvm

Add the following to ~/.bash_profile or your desired shell
configuration file:

  export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
  [ -s "/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && . "/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
  [ -s "/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && . "/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

You can set $NVM_DIR to any location, but leaving it unchanged from
/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/nvm will destroy any nvm-installed Node installations
upon upgrade/reinstall.

Type `nvm help` for further information.

Bash completion has been installed to:
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/etc/bash_completion.d
